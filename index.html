      Biography
    </div>

    <div id="modest-font" class="textbox">
      On May 2, 2000, Adam Hendrickson was born. From a young age, he was fascinated<br>
      with music. Specifically, theme songs to his favorite childrens shows, and the music<br>
      he would hear in the background score. While also developing a hobby for building Legos,<br>
      Adam would seek out any musical soundtrack material he found interesting.
      The harder it was to find, the more he wanted it.<br>
      This all came to a climax when Adam was 12 and discovered the score to an<br>
      old Cartoon Network show called Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. Adam had never heard such wonderful<br>
      music, and desperately wanted to add it to his growing music collection. Alas, The Foster's Soundtrack does<br>
      not exist anywhere. So Adam thought, "if I can't have it, I'll just have to make my own". This launched Adam into<br>
      a new phase of his life, learning HOW to write music.<br>

      As Adam got older, he continued to pursue his composition hobby, creating hours and hours of original music,<br>
      alongside covers of the Foster's Soundtrack of course. He also began to become interested in other things,<br>
      like computers. Computers were and still kind of are a total mystery to Adam. How do they even work? At around<br>
      the age of 13, Adam decided he would figure this out, and began to learn the Java programming language. Through the years,<br>
      Adam would begin many coding projects, usually strange game ideas, or tools to help with his homework. One time he even<br>
      tried to animate by programming everything out (it did not look good, but he did not give up.) The most public of Adam's<br>
      programming projects is a text-adventure game titled You are The Speaker. Programmed by Adam in 2019 and conceptualized by<br>
      two friends of his, You are The Speaker is an overhauled ZORK experience, featuring a map mechanic, interesting play features,<br>
      puzzles and more. Unfortunately, it is unlikely You Are The Speaker will ever see continued development, as it's original story<br>
      writers have little interest in the project anymore. While Adam wishes he had more polished projects to demonstrate his skills,<br>
      he is well aqcuainted with the mindset of a programmer, and finds the logic of computers relaxing and enjoyable to learn about and execute.<br>

    <! Dear grader, I'd be very curious to hear your thoughts on my method of skewing the text, up above. The row class will create 5 equal>
    <! columns for the elements to be placed. It's used in the Additional Links section for the album covers, but it works  >
    <! so well here for offsetting the text the way I had envisioned, and it remains functional and "clean" as I adjust the resolution of the page. I don't think >
    <! it's done like that in the real world, which is why I'm specifically pointing it out. Is there another way to achieve this effect? Or maybe nobody wants to achieve this effect!>

    <div id="fancy-font" class="textbox">
      After production on You are The Speaker halted, Adam began creating what he calls the "ultimate output for all my creative energy",<br>
      which is an animated series about him in high school, learning about music. The show itself follows a young Hendrickson through a<br>
      fictional high school, and a key point in the show is Adam's obsession with The Victorians Soundtrack (a nod to Foster's Home).<br>
      With the music being the focal point of the show, and over 90 minutes of screentime under his belt, Adam feels completely confident<br>
      in his show-making method, and wishes to continue this until the project's inevitable finale. Alongside this, Adam is currently enrolled<br>
      in the Front End Software Development Bootcamp, offered through Promineo Tech. This website, in fact, is an assignment for that very class!<br>
      Adam wishes to polish his software development skills, allowing him to build a comfortable life for himself, where he is free to do all<br>
      of his favorite things and more.<br>
